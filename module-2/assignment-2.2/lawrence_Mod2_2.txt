	<h1>Assignment 2.2 - Building a Web Page Exercise, Part 2 </h1>
	<h2> Chapter 1 </h2>
	<p>Growing up young Melissa lived in the mountains of California but dreamed of the sea. She living with her mother and while they moved often, they stayed within several counties that were near each other. This meant she switch schools every few years but they stayed in the mountains. This didn't seem to affect her education too much as she received a scholarship to a University in Hawaii. She was finally heading to live by the sea!</p>
	<p> University life was tuff for the young adult Melissa because she lived so far from family but she was studying Marine Biology. The courses she took could be challenging at time such as Oceanography but other classes were fascinating such as Ichthyology. As Melissa worked her way toward her Bachelors of Science she figured out that she was not meant to work in a stuffy lab. Her real passion was working with animals and educating others about the world in which they live.</p>
	<p> A large hurtle in Melissa's way for graduation was Calculus II. Calculus I had its difficult topics but was conquerable. As time was running down and the final year was looming, Melissa decided to craft an argument to take to the dean of not taking Calculus II. In essence, Melissa talked about her passion of working with animals and education and how a favorite Professor planted the idea of a practicum at the local zoo. The Dean agreed that this was acceptable trade off as the Professor would over see the Melissa's work and grade various assignments. There would also be a letter from the overseeing Zoo Keeper of Melissa's overall performance. </p>
	<p> Throughout the semester Melissa learned about the daily tasks of a keeper overseeing a large mammal section. She worked with black rhinos, lions, meerkats, baboons, hyenas, and African wild dogs. Between the dirty tasks of cleaning and feeding, keepers also would do training, enrichment, and specialized health care tasks for the various species, as well as getting out of their sections and talk to patrons about the animals. <span>This experience cemented that animal care is what Melissa wanted to do at this point in her life... but with marine animals.</span> </p>
